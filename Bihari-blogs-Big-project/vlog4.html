        Nalanda University, located in Bihar, was one of the world’s first residential universities and a major center of learning in ancient India. Founded in the 5th century CE during the Gupta Empire, it attracted scholars from all over Asia, including China, Korea, Japan, Tibet, and Sri Lanka. It is considered the world’s first fully-residential university, housing over 10,000 students and 2,000 teachers.

        Subjects taught at Nalanda included Buddhist philosophy, logic, grammar, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and art. Students were selected through rigorous entrance examinations, and the curriculum was vast and intellectual. Nalanda thrived for over 700 years, making it a hub of academic excellence and intercultural exchange.

        Chinese traveler and monk Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang) visited Nalanda in the 7th century and studied there for many years. He later wrote detailed accounts of its grandeur, libraries, and structured education system. The great libraries of Nalanda, known as *Dharmaganja*, had thousands of manuscripts and were renowned across continents.

        Sadly, in the 12th century, Nalanda was destroyed by Bakhtiyar Khilji’s army. The massive libraries reportedly burned for months. Its ruins, however, still stand today near Rajgir and serve as a testament to India’s rich academic past. The site is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

        In recent years, Nalanda has been revived as a modern university with international collaboration. The new Nalanda University near the historic site aims to revive the spirit of ancient learning with modern relevance. It continues to draw students from around the world, echoing the legacy of its ancient predecessor.
