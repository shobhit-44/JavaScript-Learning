        Litti Chokha is not just a dish but a symbol of Bihar's rich culinary and cultural heritage. This traditional Bihari meal, once known only in rural kitchens, has now gained global attention for its earthy taste, simplicity, and nutritional value. It represents the soul food of Bihar and is loved across Eastern India and parts of Nepal.

        Litti consists of wheat dough balls stuffed with sattu (roasted gram flour) mixed with spices, herbs, lemon juice, mustard oil, and ajwain. These are baked or roasted over coal or cow-dung cakes to give an authentic smoky flavor. Chokha is its perfect companion, made using mashed roasted vegetables like eggplant (baingan), tomatoes, and boiled potatoes, blended with mustard oil, garlic, chilies, and coriander.

        Traditionally, Litti was prepared in homes and served with homemade ghee, making it a complete, nutritious, and sustainable meal for farmers and villagers. Nowadays, street vendors, five-star chefs, and home cooks across India are experimenting with and popularizing Litti Chokha with modern twists, like adding ghee-tadka or serving it with chutneys.
