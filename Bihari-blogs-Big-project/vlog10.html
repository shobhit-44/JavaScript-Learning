        These historical monuments stand as a testimony to the region’s bravery, strategy, and royal legacy.

        The <strong>Rohtasgarh Fort</strong>, located on the Kaimur plateau, was a strategic military base used by Sher Shah Suri.
        It is known for its massive gates and natural defense structures. <strong>Darbhanga Fort</strong> is a symbol of Mithila architecture
        and royal heritage, located in the heart of the city of Darbhanga.

        <strong>Munger Fort</strong>, built during the Slave Dynasty, played a key role during various battles and administrative regimes.
