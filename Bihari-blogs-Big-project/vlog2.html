        Chhath Puja is one of the most sacred and culturally significant festivals of Bihar. Celebrated six days after Diwali, it is a tribute to the Sun God (Surya) and Chhathi Maiya. The festival is known for its spiritual discipline, devotion, and a strong sense of community. Chhath is not just a religious event, but a deep-rooted cultural identity for the people of Bihar and neighboring regions like Jharkhand, Eastern Uttar Pradesh, and parts of Nepal.

        This ancient Hindu festival spans four days and involves rituals like holy bathing, fasting, standing in water for long periods, and offering prasad like thekua, fruits, and sugarcane to the setting and rising sun. The festival is largely environment-friendly and showcases harmony between humans and nature. Devotees prepare for the puja with utmost purity and cleanliness, believing that even a small error in rituals may lead to divine displeasure.

        The first day is called *Nahay Khay*, where devotees take a holy dip and eat only sanctified food. The second day is *Kharna*, where a full-day fast is broken after sunset with kheer and chapati. The third day includes *Sandhya Arghya*, the evening offering to the setting sun. Finally, the fourth day is the *Usha Arghya*, the morning prayer to the rising sun, followed by breaking the fast.

        Chhath is known for its vibrant visuals—women dressed in yellow or saffron saris, holding bamboo baskets, singing folk songs at the riverbanks, and thousands standing together in rivers or ponds during sunrise and sunset. Famous locations for Chhath in Bihar include Patna’s Ganga Ghats, Bhagalpur, Muzaffarpur, and other local ponds across towns and villages.

        The festival promotes social unity, gender equality, and ecological awareness. It is often said that no other festival expresses the heart of Bihar better than Chhath. Migrants from Bihar who live in other parts of India or abroad even return home just to celebrate it. Truly, Chhath Puja is more than a ritual—it's an emotional and cultural thread that binds generations of Biharis.
