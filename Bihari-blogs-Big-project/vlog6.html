        Patna Sahib, also known as Takht Sri Harmandir Sahib, is one of the five Takhts (seats of authority) of Sikhism and holds immense spiritual significance. Located in Patna, the capital of Bihar, it is the birthplace of the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who was born here in 1666. This holy shrine is a place of pilgrimage not only for Sikhs but also for people of all faiths who come to witness its peace and grandeur.

        The gurdwara was built by Maharaja Ranjit Singh in the 19th century to honor the Guru. The white marble structure, adorned with golden domes and intricate architecture, stands as a symbol of devotion and history. Inside, you’ll find sacred relics belonging to Guru Gobind Singh Ji, including weapons, a cradle, and handwritten scriptures.

        The complex houses a langar (community kitchen) that serves free food to thousands of devotees daily. The spiritual atmosphere, combined with the serene kirtan (devotional music), creates a sense of divine peace. Visitors often describe the experience as soul-soothing and uplifting.
