        Nestled in the northwestern tip of Bihar, Valmiki Tiger Reserve is the state’s only tiger reserve and one of India’s best-kept wildlife secrets. Located in West Champaran district along the Indo-Nepal border, it stretches across the Himalayan foothills and forms part of the Valmiki National Park. It offers a perfect blend of rich biodiversity, scenic beauty, and thrilling wildlife encounters.

        The reserve spans over 900 square kilometers and is home to Bengal tigers, leopards, sloth bears, wild boars, and over 250 species of birds. It is also a part of the Terai region, known for its dense Sal forests, grasslands, swamps, and rivers like the Gandak, creating a lush and vibrant ecosystem.

The jungle safaris offer close encounters with wildlife, while treks through the forest trails introduce you to rare plants and birds. You can also experience traditional Tharu tribal culture, as local communities live in harmony with the forest and contribute to conservation efforts.
