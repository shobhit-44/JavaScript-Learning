      <p>
        Held annually in the town of Sonepur near the confluence of the Ganga and Gandak rivers, the <strong>Sonepur Mela</strong> is 
        one of Asia’s largest and oldest cattle fairs. Traditionally, it was a marketplace where traders from across India came to 
        buy and sell livestock, especially elephants and horses.

        Though modern regulations have limited the sale of certain animals, the fair remains a grand celebration of Bihar’s rural 
        spirit. Cattle, birds, goats, and even camels are traded, while vibrant stalls selling handicrafts, toys, and local food 
        add to the lively atmosphere.

        Beyond trade, the mela is known for its cultural events, circus shows, folk dances, magic performances, and joy rides. 
        People of all ages attend, making it a family festival that blends commerce with entertainment.

        Sonepur Mela is not just a fair—it’s a colorful reflection of Bihar’s heritage, community bonding, and economic vibrancy. 
        For anyone visiting Bihar in November, this fair is a must-see experience.
