      <p>
        Located in north Bihar, <strong>Muzaffarpur</strong> is famously known as the “Land of Shahi Litchis” due to its high-quality 
        litchi production that is renowned across India and even globally. The juicy, fragrant, and sweet litchis grown here have 
        received a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, highlighting their uniqueness.

      <p>
        Muzaffarpur is not just about agriculture. It is a major commercial hub for north Bihar and plays a key role in the state’s 
        trade and transport. The city is well connected by road and rail and serves as a gateway to several important regions.

      <p>
        The city also has a rich history and is home to several educational institutions and temples. The <em>Ram Chandra Shahi Museum</em>, 
        Jubba Sahni Park, and the historic temples of Baba Garib Nath and Chaturbhuj Sthan attract visitors and locals alike.

        During summer, the city buzzes with activity as farmers harvest and send tons of litchis to different corners of the country. 
        The economy of thousands of families depends on this seasonal fruit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Muzaffarpur’s blend of culture, trade, and agriculture makes it a significant part of Bihar’s identity and pride.
