        Mithila Weddings, rooted in the ancient Maithil culture of Bihar, are known for their vibrant customs, intricate rituals, and timeless elegance. These traditional weddings are not just social events but deeply spiritual and cultural experiences that showcase the values and heritage of the Mithila region.

      <p>
        What makes Mithila weddings unique is their strict adherence to Vedic traditions passed down through generations. From matching the *Kundalis* (horoscopes) to *Panigrahan Sanskar* (wedding vows), every ritual is performed with deep respect and precision. The use of *Maithili language*, traditional songs, and ceremonial purity adds to the authenticity of these grand occasions.

        The bride is adorned in bright red or yellow silk sarees, with traditional *Maang Tika*, *Paag* (headgear), and intricate *Madhubani* mehndi designs on her hands. The groom often wears a dhoti-kurta or sherwani, with a *Mithila-style Paag* and garlands made of tulsi and flowers.

        A special feature of Maithil weddings is the *Saurath Sabha*, a unique matchmaking fair where family astrologers and community elders meet to finalize matches. Another striking tradition is *Kohbar Ghar*, a decorated room painted with fertility symbols and Madhubani art where sacred rituals are performed.

        With folk songs like *Sohar*, *Samdaun*, and *Bidhai*, sung by women, the entire wedding becomes an emotionally rich cultural expression. Guests are treated to a lavish spread of traditional dishes like *Kadhi Bari*, *Tarkari*, *Malpua*, and *Pua*.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, while modern elements are being included, the heart of Mithila weddings still beats with age-old values, artistic traditions, and community bonding. It’s a true celebration of love, family, and Bihari pride.
