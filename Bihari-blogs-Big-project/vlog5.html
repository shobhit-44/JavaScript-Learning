        Madhubani Art, also known as Mithila Painting, is a famous folk art form that originates from the Mithila region of Bihar, especially from the town of Madhubani. This art is characterized by intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and strong cultural themes. Traditionally created by women on walls and floors of homes during festivals and religious occasions, it has now gained global recognition and is practiced on canvas, paper, cloth, and more.

        The themes of Madhubani paintings often revolve around mythology, nature, love, fertility, and daily life. Popular subjects include Hindu deities like Krishna, Ram, Shiva, Durga, and Lakshmi, along with animals, birds, trees, and geometric patterns. The use of natural colors derived from flowers, leaves, turmeric, and soot adds an eco-friendly charm to the paintings.

        Traditionally, Madhubani was done using fingers, twigs, matchsticks, or brushes made from bamboo sticks. The paintings are bordered with decorative motifs, and there is usually no empty space left in the composition. This unique style makes every Madhubani artwork look rich, dense, and meaningful.

        Madhubani art is more than just painting—it's a reflection of the socio-religious beliefs of the region. It is often used in rituals, weddings, festivals like Holi and Diwali, and even to mark special events in villages. Over time, this art form became a voice for women’s empowerment and cultural preservation in Bihar.

        Today, Madhubani artists are recognized nationally and internationally, and their works are exhibited in museums and galleries across the globe. The Indian government has also given it a GI (Geographical Indication) tag, safeguarding its identity. It continues to thrive as a symbol of Bihar’s artistic soul and rich cultural legacy.
